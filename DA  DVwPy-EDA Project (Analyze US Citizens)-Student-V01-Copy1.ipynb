    "One of the most important components to any data science experiment that doesn’t get as much importance as it should is **``Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)``**. In short, EDA is **``\"A first look at the data\"``**. It is a critical step in analyzing the data from an experiment. It is used to understand and summarize the content of the dataset to ensure that the features which we feed to our machine learning algorithms are refined and we get valid, correctly interpreted results.\n",
    "In general, looking at a column of numbers or a whole spreadsheet and determining the important characteristics of the data can be very tedious and boring. Moreover, it is good practice to understand the problem statement and the data before you get your hands dirty, which in view, helps to gain a lot of insights. I will try to explain the concept using the Adult dataset/Census Income dataset available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). The problem statement here is to predict whether the income exceeds 50k a year or not based on the census data.\n",

    "- **salary (target feature/label):** whether or not an individual makes more than $50,000 annually. (<= 50K, >50K)\n",

    "- **fnlwgt:** this is the number of people the census believes the entry represents. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.(Integer greater than 0)\n",

    "- **education-num:** the highest level of education achieved in numerical form. (Integer greater than 0)\n",

Married-spouse-absent includes married people living apart because either the husband or wife was employed and living at a considerable distance from home (Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse)\n",

    "- **sex:** the biological sex of the individual. (Male, female)\n",
